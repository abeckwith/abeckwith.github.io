    <h2>We've had the picture of Hub Cycle for awhile, but were never sure where the picture was taken, nor who the other people in the picture were - I assumed they were just random anonymous workers. 
        Cori did some investigation and looked at a current picture online of one of the old Hub addresses and we've finally figured out
        where this picture was taken!<p>  Here's what we've got...<br><hr></h2>
    <h3>Hub Cycle circa 1900-1906, 29 Cooper St. North End, Boston (building built in 1890):</h3>

    <h3>29 Cooper St., June 2017: one of 1st floor windows filled in, basement store turned into apartment, 
    transom above door on left filled in:</h3>

        <h2>In 1900, it was the Berkowitz Brothers shop, implying that it was family owned and run</h2>
<hr>
    <h2>Who are the people with JB in the Hub Cycle photo, given it was a family business?<br>
    Here is JB's father Leopold in the Beckwith book, next to a closeup of a worker in the Hub Cycle photo:<Br>
        <img src="images/Leopoldbook.jpg">
        <img src="images/Leopold.jpg"><Br>
        
        Recall that Leopold worked for JB in 1900 - <u>this is his father</u>!<br>
        Here is the 1900 Census for 18 Cooper St. (see below).  The first image shows the whole family, the 2nd one shows their corresponding occupations.  Notice that the father, Leopold, is listed as "Bicycle Worker", while the son, JB, is listed as "Bicycle Manufacturer" (or "Manager"?):<br>

        <h3>Sam may be the other worker (I think someone said that Sam had his ear's pinned - but would it have been by the time this picture was taken?):</h3><br>

            <h2>18 Cooper Street: the entire Berkowitz family lived there in 1900 and it is about 100 feet away from the store.  The building was built in 1896:</h2>

        <h2><font color = "red">Who is the guy on the right in the original picture?  </font><br>Cori thinks it's Louis and it's true that Hub Cycle was first the Berkowitz Brothers (JB and Louis), but I don't think it looks like him, even though it would make sense to be him.  <br>Then again, I'm used to just one or two pictures and Gail or Jon may remember what he actually looked like?  Or maybe another relative can be given this link?  Remember that it looks like all three other adults are Berkowitz', so it would make sense if this was one of the brothers.  Also notice that he has a work overalls on.<br>Here's the lineup:</h2><h3>Who is this? Does he look like any of the brothers?</h3>
