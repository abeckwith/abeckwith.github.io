    <h2>We've had the picture of Hub Cycle for awhile, but were never sure where the picture was taken, nor who the other people in the picture were - I assumed they were just random anonymous workers.  Cori did some investigation and looked at a current picture online of one of the old Hub addresses.  Here's what we've got...<br><hr></h2>
    <h3>Hub Cycle circa 1900, 29 Cooper St. North End, built in 1890:</h3>

    <h2>Who are the people with JB in the Hub Cycle photo, given it was a family business?<br>
    Here is JB's father Leopold in the Beckwith book, next to a closeup of a worker in the Hub Cycle photo:<Br>

        Recall that Leopold worked for JB in 1900 - this is his father!
        </h2>
        <h3>Sam may be the other worker (I think someone said that Sam had his ear's pinned - but would it have been by the time this picture was taken?):</h3><br>

            <h2>18 Cooper Street: the entire Berkowitz family lived there in 1900 and it is about 100 feet away from the store.  The building was built in 1895:</h2>
    <h2>In 1900, it was the Berkowitz Brothers shop, implying that it was family owned and run</h2>
